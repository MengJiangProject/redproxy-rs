# Milu Language Design and Syntax Review

**Date:** 2023-10-27 (Placeholder Date)
**Reviewer:** Jules (AI Language Model)
**Subject:** Analysis of Milu language design concerning User-Defined Types, Generic Functions, Pattern Matching, and Monads.

**1. Introduction**

This report details a review of the Milu language, based on its `MILU_LANG_GUIDE.md` and relevant source code files (`milu/src/parser/rules.rs`, `milu/src/script/types.rs`, `milu/src/script/value.rs`, `milu/src/script/functions.rs`). The purpose of this review is to assess the current state of the language's design and syntax with respect to four key feature areas: user-defined types, generic functions, pattern matching, and monads. This review focuses on identifying existing capabilities and gaps, without proposing specific implementation changes.

**2. Current Language Features (Summary from Step 1)**

Milu is presented as an embedded, statically typed, pure functional, and lazy-evaluated DSL. Key characteristics relevant to this review include:

*   **Syntax:** C-like and expression-based. Uses `let ... in ...` for bindings. Control flow is managed by `if ... then ... else ...`.
*   **Type System:**
    *   Built-in types include `Integer`, `Boolean`, `String`, `Array[T]` (homogeneous), `Tuple(T1, T2, ...)`, `NativeObject` (host-provided), and `Any`.
    *   Type inference is used; explicit type annotations in function definitions are not currently supported.
    *   Arrays are dynamically checked for homogeneity.
*   **Functions:**
    *   First-class citizens, defined using `let name(args) = body;`.
    *   Support closures (capture their lexical environment).
    *   Recursive functions are supported.
    *   The static signature of user-defined functions, as per the current implementation, often defaults to `Type::Any` for arguments and return types from an external perspective, with type checking occurring during evaluation or more specific inference.
*   **Data Structures:** Primarily `Array` and `Tuple`. `NativeObject` allows interaction with host-defined complex data.

**3. Gaps Analysis**

**3.1. User-Defined Types (Details from Step 2)**

*   **Absence:** Milu currently lacks any syntax or semantic support for users to define their own nominal types, such as structures (records with named fields) or enumerations (tagged unions).
*   **Current Alternatives:** Data aggregation relies on `Tuple` (heterogeneous, fixed-size, index-based access) and `Array` (homogeneous, variable-size, index-based access), or `NativeObject`s provided by the host.
*   **Implications:**
    *   **Data Modeling:** Limited ability to create domain-specific data structures, leading to reliance on less expressive tuples or arrays.
    *   **Type Safety:** Reduced capacity for nominal typing; structurally similar tuples used for different conceptual types are indistinguishable.
    *   **Readability & Organization:** Code can be harder to understand and maintain without named types and fields. Access via numerical indices (e.g., `data.0`, `data.1`) is less descriptive than named fields (e.g., `user.name`, `user.age`).

**3.2. Generic Functions (Details from Step 3)**

*   **Absence:** There is no syntax for defining functions with type parameters (parametric polymorphism). Users cannot write functions like `fn process<T>(input: T) -> T;`.
*   **Current State:**
    *   Functions operate on concrete types or use `Type::Any`.
    *   Built-in operations (e.g., `==`, array functions) exhibit some polymorphic behavior, but this is not extensible by users.
    *   Homogeneity in arrays (`Array[T]`) is an internal concept rather than a user-level generic type parameter for functions.
*   **Implications:**
    *   **Code Reusability:** Difficulty in writing reusable code that operates abstractly over different data types, often leading to code duplication or loss of type specificity.
    *   **Type Safety:** While the language aims for static typing, the lack of user-defined generics limits the ability to write statically type-safe, abstract functions. Operations often default to `Any` or rely on runtime checks.
    *   **Expressiveness:** The language cannot easily express higher-order abstractions that are common in functional languages with robust generic systems.

**3.3. Pattern Matching (Details from Step 4)**

*   **Absence:** Milu does not have a dedicated pattern matching construct (e.g., `match`, `switch`).
*   **Current Alternatives:** Conditional logic relies on `if-then-else` expressions. Data deconstruction is manual via tuple indexing (`.0`, `.1`), array indexing (`[]`), and `NativeObject` property access (`.`).
*   **Implications:**
    *   **Verbosity & Readability:** Complex conditional logic based on data structure and values can become verbose and hard to follow using nested `if-then-else` statements.
    *   **Deconstruction:** Lacks elegant and simultaneous checking of structure and binding of parts to variables.
    *   **Exhaustiveness:** No mechanism to check if conditional logic covers all possible states of a data type (especially relevant if enums were introduced).
    *   **Error Proneness:** Manual deconstruction and conditional chains can be more error-prone than compiler-assisted pattern matching.

**3.4. Monads (Details from Step 5)**

*   **Absence:** The language does not provide built-in monadic types like `Option<T>` (for optionality) or `Result<T, E>` (for error handling). There is no syntactic sugar (e.g., `do` notation) for monadic composition.
*   **Current Handling of Optionality/Errors:**
    *   Optionality is managed by convention (e.g., empty strings, special values for `NativeObject` fields), as there is no `null` or `undefined` type.
    *   Errors from operations typically result in runtime errors handled by the host environment, not as values manageable within Milu scripts.
*   **Implications:**
    *   **Clarity & Explicitness:** The handling of potentially missing values or operations that can fail is not explicit in function signatures or types, making it harder to reason about code.
    *   **Type Safety:** Conventions for optionality/errors are less safe than using dedicated types that enforce handling of all cases.
    *   **Composability:** Composing operations that might not return a value or might fail is cumbersome and error-prone without monadic abstractions.
    *   **Functional Purity:** While aspiring to be pure, the current error handling (runtime exceptions) and optionality (conventions) are less aligned with idiomatic pure functional approaches that use monadic types to internalize these concerns.

**4. Conclusion**

The Milu language, in its current state, provides a basic functional DSL. However, for more advanced use cases, data modeling, and robust error handling in line with modern functional programming practices, it exhibits significant gaps in the areas of user-defined types, generic functions, pattern matching, and monadic structures. Addressing these areas would considerably enhance the language's expressiveness, type safety, reusability, and robustness.

# Part 2: Proposed High-Level Syntax Design for Milu Evolution

**Date:** 2023-10-27 (Placeholder Date)
**Author:** Jules (AI Language Model)
**Subject:** High-level syntax proposals for User-Defined Types, Generic Functions, Pattern Matching, and Monads, based on prior review and agreed design principles.

**1. Design Principles (Recap)**

*   Consistency with existing Milu syntax.
*   Inspiration from Rust and ML-family languages (Haskell, OCaml).
*   Clarity and Readability.
*   Expressiveness and Power.
*   Minimalism (where appropriate for an embedded DSL).
*   Facilitate Static Typing.

**2. User-Defined Types (Haskell/OCaml Inspired)**

*   **General Keyword:** `type`
*   **Enums (Sum Types):**
    ```milu
    type MyEnumName =
        | VariantA                     // Simple variant
        | VariantB(Type1, Type2)       // Variant with unnamed positional data
        | VariantC { field1: Type1,    // Variant with named fields
                     field2: Type2 }
        ; // Optional semicolon
    ```
    *   Instantiation: `MyEnumName::VariantA`, `MyEnumName::VariantB(val1, val2)`, `MyEnumName::VariantC { field1: v1, field2: v2 }`.

*   **Structs/Records (Product Types - as single-variant sum types):**
    ```milu
    type MyStructName = MyStructName {
        fieldA: TypeA,
        fieldB: TypeB,
    }; // Optional semicolon
    ```
    *   Instantiation: `MyStructName { fieldA: valA, fieldB: valB }`.
    *   Field Access: `instanceName.fieldA`.

**3. Generic Functions**

*   **Declaration:** Angle brackets `<...>` for type parameters after the function name.
    ```milu
    let functionName<T, U>(param1: T, param2: U) -> ReturnType<T> =
        // ... function body ...
        ; // Optional semicolon
    ```
*   Type parameters (`T`, `U`) can be used in argument types and return types.
*   Type inference at call site is expected.

**4. Pattern Matching**

*   **`match` Expression:**
    ```milu
    match expression_to_match {
        pattern1 => result_expression1,
        pattern2 if guard_condition => result_expression2,
        StructName { fieldA: bind_A, fieldB: _ } => result_expression3, // Destructuring struct
        EnumName::VariantB(bind_val) => result_expression4,       // Destructuring enum
        (x, y) => result_expression5,                             // Destructuring tuple
        [first, ...rest] => result_expression6,                   // Destructuring array
        literal_value => result_expression7,
        variable_to_bind => result_expression8,
        _ => default_result_expression,                           // Wildcard
    }
    ```
*   Patterns include literals, variables, struct destructuring, enum variant destructuring, tuple destructuring, basic array destructuring (including rest), and `_` wildcard.
*   `|` for alternative patterns within an arm (e.g., `patternA | patternB => ...`).
*   Guards: `pattern if condition => ...`.
*   Exhaustiveness checking is desirable.

**5. Monads - `Option<T>` and `Result<T, E>`**

*   **Definition:** Defined as standard library generic enums using the `type` syntax above.
    ```milu
    // Standard Library (conceptual)
    type Option<T> = Some(T) | None;
    type Result<T, E> = Ok(T) | Err(E);
    ```
*   **Construction:** Namespaced variant names.
    *   `Option::Some(value)`, `Option::None`
    *   `Result::Ok(value)`, `Result::Err(error_value)`
*   **Consumption:** Primarily via `match` expressions.
*   **Syntactic Sugar:** The `?` operator for error/None propagation.
    ```milu
    let value = some_function_returning_option_or_result()?;
    ```

**6. Conclusion of High-Level Design**

This consolidated syntax design aims to significantly enhance Milu's capabilities in data modeling, code reuse, and robust programming. It provides a foundation for features common in modern, statically-typed functional languages, tailored to Milu's context. Further detailed specification will be required for each feature, considering edge cases, type system interactions, and implementation strategies.
